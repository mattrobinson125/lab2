This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The following lines of code import necessary libraries to execute this code:

``` {imports}
library(flexdashboard)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggstance)
library(ggalt)
```

We then import the data set obtained from the Washington Post police shootings database. Then, we clean up the code by changing dates, genders, races, and manners of death to an understandable format.

```{setup}
fatalshootings <- read.csv("./fatal-police-shootings-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
fatalshootings$date <- ymd(fatalshootings$date)
fatalshootings[,c(4:5,7:8,9:14)] <- lapply(fatalshootings[,c(4:5,7:8,9:14)], as.factor)
levels(fatalshootings$gender) <- c("Female", "Male")
levels(fatalshootings$race) <- c("Unknown", "Asian", "Black", "Hispanic", "Unknown", "Other", "White")
fatalshootings$race <- factor(fatalshootings$race, levels(fatalshootings$race)[c(5,2,1,4,3,6)])
levels(fatalshootings$flee) <- c("Unknown", "Car", "Foot", "Not fleeing", "Other")
fatalshootings$flee <- factor(fatalshootings$flee, levels(fatalshootings$flee)[c(1,5,3,2,4)])
levels(fatalshootings$manner_of_death) <- c("Beaten", "Shot", "Shot/Tasered")
fatalshootings$manner_of_death <- factor(fatalshootings$manner_of_death, levels(fatalshootings$manner_of_death)[c(1,3,2)])
```

```{Race/Ethnicity}
ggplot(data = fatalshootings, aes(y = race)) + 
        geom_barh(aes(fill = ..count..)) +
        theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
        scale_fill_gradient(low = "royalblue3", high = "navyblue") +
        labs(y = NULL, x = "Number of deaths")
```
